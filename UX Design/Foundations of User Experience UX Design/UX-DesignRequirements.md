## UX Design business requirements

You're learned that design thinkking is a user-centered and multi-stage approach to solving problems. Its goal is to create products that effectively address real user needs. And it has five phases: empathizing with users, defining their needs, ideating solutions, prototyping solutions, and testing those solutions.

You've also learned that while this process looks neat and linear, the reality is often more cyclical. The best UX designers iterate throughout the process, moving back and forth between stages to do things like redefine user needs or develop alternative prototypes.
In fact, in many real-world situations, design doesn't even start with empathizing. Instead, it starts when a designer gets an assignment for a new project. Good UX designers take time to carefully understand these assignments before they move forward. Why? Because most assignments include crucial business requirements that must be considered aat every stage of the design thinking process.

## Business requirements
For any UX design project, business requirements come from whatever entity assigns the project. That entity might be a for-profit business, a nonprofit organization, a governmental organization, or something else. But no matteer where they come from, business requirements typically include two kinds of information: goals and parameters/

Business goals typically describe:
The users they want the design to target
The outcomes they want the design to achieve
Their vision foor the design's final look and functionality

Business parameters typically describe :
The project's budget, timeline and scope
The specific tools and systems that designers must use and design for
The requirements and standards the desing must meet
Business requirement vary depending on the project and its key players, and they can often be negotiated over the project's lifecycle. And just as these requirements may evolve over the course of the project, so too should they shape designers' execution of the design thinking process in powerful way
