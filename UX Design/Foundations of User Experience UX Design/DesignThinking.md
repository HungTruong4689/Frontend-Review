# Design thinking: A UX Design Framework

### A framework
-   A conceptual tool that provides guidance on the best practices and processes for solving problems and building solutions -> show the problems of real users.
- Structure for the design process
-   Foster collaboration -> spack innovations

### Design thinking
- sequence the assignments that contribute to the designs that you'll create throughout the program

-   User-centered approach

### Empathize
-    Learning about users and their problems,wants, needs
-   Important: Step away from your assumptions and guesses
-   Let your research findings inform your decision-making in later design phases
-   surveys, interviews and observation sessions
-   conduct some research on the competitor's products

### Define
-   Analyze the research findings form the empathize phase
-   Determine which user problems are the most important to solve, and why. This will drive you toward a clear goal for the desing of the product.
-   The most important outcome of this phase is a clear problem statement, which is a description of the user's need that your designs will address. You might also a value proposition, which is a summary of why your user would or should use the product or service that your're designing.
### Ideate
    After you land on a user problem and establish why it's an important one to solve, it's time for the ideate phase. The goal of ideation is to come up with as design solutions as possible - don't settle for your first solution because the most obvious is not always the right one.
    Ideation involves collaborative brainstorming with other members of your team to generate as many solutions as possible to a problem. This could include marketing, engineering, product management, or any other stakeholders for the product or service. During brainstorming sessions, you should explore all possible solutions. Don't focus on whether something is a "good" or "bad" idea, just collect as many ideas as you can. The important thing here is to keep this process judgment-free.
    After brainstorming, you'll then analyze your potential solutions and start to make choices about which one are the best solutions to pursue as prototypes. You might return to user or competitive research to help you narrow down your ideas, and you might also create user flows to illustrate how the user will interact with your solution.
### Prototype
### Test
    After you have an idea of how to solve the problem, you're ready to enter the prototype phase, where your goal is to produce an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality and can be used for testing. The test phase is critical to develop the right solution to address your user's problem, and an organized approach to testing can help you create exceptional user experiences.
    Prototyping and testing are interconnected, which means that you'll test your designs at each stage of prototype development rather than waiting to test until after the working prototype is complete. If the design is too polished the first time you present it to users, you might not get as much feedback. Think about ways to include testing throughout the design process, so that you're iterating your designs based on user feedback instead of other reasons.
    For example, you might test the concepts behind your design by presenting users with a simple sketch, wireframe, or a sitemap. Taking what you learned, you might iterate on that design on paper (known as a low-fidelity prototype) and conduct another round of user testing. At some point, you'll iterate the design again into a working, interactive model using a software program (also known as a high-fidelity prototype) and test that as well. You might also consider testing more than  one prototype at the same time  to get feedback on multiple solutions, or testing the same prototype on multiple platforms such as laptop, tablet, and smartphone.
    The goal of testing prototypes is to continue to refine the prototype as you gain insigt into whether the design for your product or service is easy to use and solves the user's problem. At some point, you'll finalize a prototype, and then you'll provide it to developers, who will then turn your design into a product.

### Key takeaways
    The design thinking framework is only one type of framework that UX designers use to organize thier appoach to designs, often based on the product they're designing and the organization they're working for. No matter which frameworks you use in your career,
